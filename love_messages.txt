You’ve ruined me for anyone else — and I’ve never been happier to be ruined.
Good morning, the only person who can turn my worst days into something bearable with a single text.
I am hopelessly, recklessly, and unapologetically in love with you.

Good morning, my sun and stars, my chaos and calm.
You are the softest part of my soul and the loudest part of my heart.
I could spend a thousand mornings telling you how much I love you and still fall short.
Every version of me in every universe is in love with every version of you.
If I only had one breath left, I’d use it to say your name.
The universe knew what it was doing when it put you in my path — and I’ll never stop being grateful.
I could write a novel about you, but it’d just be 300 pages of “I love her.”
You make me believe in things I never trusted before — fate, love, morning cuddles.
Good morning to the only person who’s ever made me believe I was worthy of love.

Good morning, my entire universe, squeezed into one perfect human.
You are the storm and the shelter. The fire and the light.
Every part of me was waiting for you before I even knew your name.
You are the poem I never finished, the kiss I never want to end.
Just existing in the same timeline as you is my life’s greatest blessing.
You are my sunbeam, my moonrise, my everything in between.
Good morning. My soul feels less lonely just knowing you exist.
You are the miracle I never asked for, but desperately needed.
